# Rattler

Rattler is a library that provides common functionality used within the conda ecosystem.
The goal of the library is to enable programs and other libraries to easily interact with the conda ecosystem without being dependent on Python.
Its primary use case is as a library that you can use to provide conda related workflows in your own tools.

Rattler is written in Rust and tries to provide a clean API to its functionalities.

This package provides bindings to the native Rust library compiled to WASM.
