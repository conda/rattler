description: "\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/actions)\n[![Join the Gitter Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/mamba-org/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n[![docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mamba/badge/?version=latest&style=flat)](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest)\n\n`mamba` is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++.\n\n- parallel downloading of repository data and package files using multi-threading\n- libsolv for much faster dependency solving, a state of the art library used in the RPM package manager of Red Hat, Fedora and OpenSUSE\n- core parts of `mamba` are implemented in C++ for maximum efficiency\n\nAt the same time, `mamba` utilizes the same command line parser, package installation and deinstallation code and transaction verification routines as `conda` to stay as compatible as possible.\n\nMamba is part of a bigger ecosystem to make scientific packaging more sustainable. You can read our [announcement blog post](https://medium.com/@QuantStack/open-software-packaging-for-science-61cecee7fc23).\nThe ecosystem also consists of `quetz`, an open source `conda` package server and `boa`, a fast `conda` package builder.\n\n\nPlease refer to the [`mamba` and `micromamba` installation guide](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) in the documentation.\n\n\n`mamba` and `micromamba` come with features on top of stock `conda`.\n\n\nTo efficiently query repositories and query package dependencies you can use `mamba repoquery` or `micromamba repoquery`.\nSee the [repoquery documentation](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html#repoquery) for details.\n\n\n`micromamba` can be used to install lock files generated by [conda-lock](https://conda-incubator.github.io/conda-lock/) without having to install `conda-lock`. Simply invoke e.g. `micromamba create -n my-env -f conda-lock.yml` with an environment lockfile named `*-lock.yml` or `*-lock.yaml`.\n"
