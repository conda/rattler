//! Replaces the prefix placeholder recorded in `paths.json` with the target prefix.
//!
//! Two paths do the same job. The search-based one scans the file contents for the placeholder;
//! the offsets-based one splices the positions a producer recorded in `paths.json`, as proposed by
//! the [draft CEP]. Both build the same patch lists ([`TextPatch`], [`CStringPatch`]) and hand them
//! to the same splicers, which is what keeps them byte-for-byte identical.
//!
//! Text files live in [`text`], binary files in [`binary`], and this module holds what they share:
//! the per-encoding prefixes, the patch types and the two entry points that dispatch on
//! `file_mode`.
