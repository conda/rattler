/// Reads a file with conditional checks based on provided metadata.

/// This function reads a file and validates that it hasn't been modified since
/// the metadata was collected. If the file has been modified (`ETag` or
/// `last_modified` doesn't match), it returns a `ConditionNotMatch` error.
///
/// If metadata has no `ETag` or `last_modified` (either because the file didn't exist,
/// precondition checks are disabled, or the backend doesn't support it), the file
/// is read without conditional checks.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `op`: A reference to the `Operator`, which facilitates file system
///   operations.
/// - `path`: A string slice that specifies the file path to read.
/// - `metadata`: The metadata to use for conditional read validation.
///
/// # Returns
/// Returns `Ok(Buffer)` if the file is successfully read and conditions match.
/// Returns `Err` with `ConditionNotMatch` if the file was modified since
/// metadata collection.

/// This function writes a file and validates that it hasn't been modified since

/// match), it returns a `ConditionNotMatch` error.
///
/// When the file didn't exist during metadata collection (etag is None), this
/// function uses `if_not_exists` to ensure the file still doesn't exist,
/// preventing race conditions where another process creates it first.

/// If metadata has no etag (either because the file didn't exist, precondition
/// checks are disabled, or the backend doesn't support it), the file is written
/// without conditional checks.

/// - `path`: A string slice that specifies the file path to write.
/// - `data`: The data to write to the file.
/// - `metadata`: The metadata to use for conditional write validation.
///
/// # Returns
/// Returns `Ok(())` if the file is successfully written and conditions match.
/// Returns `Err` with `ConditionNotMatch` if the file was modified since
/// metadata collection or if the file was created when it shouldn't exist.
