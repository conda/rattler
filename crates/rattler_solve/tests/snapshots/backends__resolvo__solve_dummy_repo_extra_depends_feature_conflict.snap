Cannot solve the request because of: The following packages are incompatible
├─ foo >=4.0 can be installed with any of the following options:
│  └─ foo 4.0.2
└─ foo[with-bar] * cannot be installed because there are no viable options:
   └─ foo[with-bar] 3.0.2 would require
      └─ foo ==3.0.2 py36h1af98f8_1[md5=fb731d9290f0bcbf3a054665f33ec94f, sha256=67a63bec3fd3205170eaad532d487595b8aaceb9814d13c6858d7bac3ef24cd4], which cannot be installed because there are no viable options:
         └─ foo 3.0.2, which conflicts with the versions reported above.
