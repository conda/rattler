Cannot solve the request because of: The following packages are incompatible
├─ bors >=2 can be installed with any of the following options:
│  └─ bors 2.0 | 2.1
└─ foobar >=2 cannot be installed because there are no viable options:
   └─ foobar 2.0 | 2.1 would require
      └─ bors <2.0, which cannot be installed because there are no viable options:
         └─ bors 1.0 | 1.1 | 1.2.1, which conflicts with the versions reported above.
