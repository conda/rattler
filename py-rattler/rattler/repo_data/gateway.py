    The gateway manages all the quircks and complex bits of efficiently acquiring
    repodata. It implements all the necessary logic to fetch the repodata from a
    remote server, cache it locally and convert it into python objects.

    The gateway can also easily be used concurrently, as it is designed to be
    thread-safe. When two threads are querying the same channel at the same time,
    their requests are coalesced into a single request. This is done to reduce the
    number of requests made to the remote server and reduce the overall memory usage.

    The gateway caches the repodata internally, so if the same channel is queried
    multiple times the records will only be fetched once. However, the conversion
    of the records to a python object is done every time the query method is called.
    Therefor, instead of requesting records directly, its more efficient to pass the
    gateway itself to methods that accepts it.
