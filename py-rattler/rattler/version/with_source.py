    Holds a version and the string it was created from. This is useful if
    you want to retain the original string the version was created from.
    This might be useful in cases where you have multiple strings that
    are represented by the same [`Version`] but you still want to be able to
    distinguish them.

    The string `1.1` and `1.01` represent the same version. When you print
    the parsed version though it will come out as `1.1`. You loose the
    original representation. This class stores the original source string,
    which can be accessed by `source` property.

    This class derives from `Version` which allows you to compare it with
    other `Version` objects.

    Comparison will be done based on the parsed version, not the source string.
