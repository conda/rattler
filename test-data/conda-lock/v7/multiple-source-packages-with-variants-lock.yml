# V6 lock file with source packages that have variants as optional metadata
#
# This tests that variants can be included in V6 as optional metadata
# in the package definitions. Note that variants cannot be used in the
# package selectors in V6 (that would be a breaking change), so packages
# must be distinguishable by other means (name, version, etc.).
